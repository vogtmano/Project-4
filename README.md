# Project 4 - Easy Browser

Days 24-26 of 100 Days Of Swift

https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100

## Topics

Day 24: WKWebView, loadView(), delegation, and action sheets.

Day 25: UIProgressView, UIToolBar, URL, URLRequest, and key-value observing.

## Challenges

Day 26:

1. If users try to visit a URL that isn’t allowed, show an alert saying it’s blocked.
2. Try making two new toolbar items with the titles Back and Forward. You should make them use webView.goBack and webView.goForward.
3. For more of a challenge, try changing the initial view controller to a table view like in project 1, where users can choose their website from a list rather than just having the first in the array loaded up front.
